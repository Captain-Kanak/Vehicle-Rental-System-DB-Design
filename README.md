# Vehicle Rental System - Database Design & SQL Queries

## Project Overview
This project involves designing a relational database for a **Vehicle Rental System** and writing SQL queries to manage users, vehicles, and bookings. The system supports two user roles (Admin and Customer), tracks vehicle availability, and manages rental records.

## Tech Stack
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Design Tool:** [drawsql.app](https://drawsql.app/)

## Database Schema (ERD)
The database consists of three main tables:
1. **Users:** Stores user profiles and roles (`Admin` or `Customer`).
2. **Vehicles:** Manages vehicle details, types, and availability status.
3. **Bookings:** Tracks rental transactions between users and vehicles.

**ERD Link:** [ERD Link](https://drawsql.app/teams/lazy-programmer-2/diagrams/vehicle-rental-system-management)

## Key Features
- **One-to-Many Relationship:** One user can have multiple bookings.
- **Many-to-One Relationship:** Multiple bookings can be associated with a single vehicle over time.
- **Unique Constraints:** Emails and Registration numbers are unique.
- **Status Management:** Real-time tracking of booking and vehicle status.

## SQL Query Solutions
The solutions for the required SQL tasks can be found in the `queries.sql` file. It covers:
- **JOINs:** Combining User and Vehicle data for booking reports.
- **EXISTS:** Identifying unbooked vehicles.
- **Filtering:** Finding available vehicles by type.
- **Aggregation:** Counting bookings per vehicle with `HAVING` filters.
